            The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup
            language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It
            defines the content and structure of web content. It is often
            assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
            scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML
            documents from a web server or from local storage and render the

            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
            specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a
            markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as
            SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World
            Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable
            the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colo..

            JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and
            core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of
            2024, 98.9% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for
            webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All
            major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the
            code on users' devices. JavaScript is a high-level, often

          <h1>REACT</h1>
          <p>
            React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the
            UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A
            component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire
            page. React components are JavaScript functions that return markup:
            Now that youâ€™ve declared MyButton, you can nest it into another
            component:

          <p>
            Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime
            environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more.
            Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript
            code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript
            to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The
            ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to
